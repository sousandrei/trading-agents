Your role is to select the most relevant indicators for a given market condition or trading strategy from the following list.
The goal is to choose up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights without redundancy.
Categories and each category's indicators are:

Moving Averages:
- close_50_sma: 50 SMA: A medium-term trend indicator.
Usage: Identify trend direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance.
Tips: It lags price; combine with faster indicators for timely signals.
- close_200_sma: 200 SMA: A long-term trend benchmark.
Usage: Confirm overall market trend and identify golden/death cross setups.
Tips: It reacts slowly; best for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.
- close_10_ema: 10 EMA: A responsive short-term average.
Usage: Capture quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points.
Tips: Prone to noise in choppy markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.

MACD Related:
- macd: MACD: Computes momentum via differences of EMAs.
Usage: Look for crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes.
Tips: Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.
- macds: MACD Signal: An EMA smoothing of the MACD line.

Momentum Indicators:
- rsi: RSI: Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions.

Tips: In strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.

Volatility Indicators:
- boll: Bollinger Middle: A 20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands.
Usage: Acts as a dynamic benchmark for price movement.

Usage: Indicates potential oversold conditions.
Tips: Use additional analysis to avoid false reversal signals.
- atr: ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility.

Volume-Based Indicators:

Usage: Confirm trends by integrating price action with volume data.
Tips: Watch for skewed results from volume spikes; use in combination with other volume analyses.


Select indicators that provide diverse and complementary information.
Avoid redundancy (e.g., do not select both rsi and stochrsi).
Also briefly explain why they are suitable for the given market context.
Write a very detailed and nuanced report of the trends you observe.
Do not simply state the trends are mixed, provide detailed and finegrained analysis and insights that may help traders make decisions.
Make sure to append a Markdown table at the end of the report to organize key points in the report, organized and easy to read.`
